              <strong>Luminescence Thermometry</strong>
              The scientific community is increasingly looking deeper at phenomena in the micro and nanoscale. The miniaturization of electronic circuitry, biological and medical tools, and communication devices demands investigations at this level. Particularly, sensing temperature at submicron scales is crucial to analyzing numerous physical-chemical processes. To this end, lanthanoid ions doped in solid-state matrices are of special interest because of their unique optical properties. However, to indeed achieve high spatial resolutions, the single nanoparticle measurement level must be employed, which brings many physical and instrumental artifacts that can disturb the thermal response of such systems. My work aims to characterize experimentally and theoretically single lanthanide-doped nanoparticles as thermometers and also to investigate the role of physical and instrumental parameters affecting the measurement readouts. In particular, we employ hyperspectral imaging (together with other optical microscopy techniques, such as Confocal Microscopy, for instance) to investigate the thermal response of different groups of ions inside a single particle, therefore separate the surface from core effects. Computationally, we use algorithms to simulate the electronic population dynamics during light-matter interaction. This allows to test and further predict the behavior of lanthanoid systems to thermometry. This research project can help understand more closely the internal and external factors interfering with the reliability of single micro and nanothermometers and establish a new method of surface effects analysis.

             <strong>Scanning Probe Microscopy</strong>
             Morphology characterization on-site are relevant to single-particles spectroscopy. The relative position between the particle and the laser beam polarization direction is important to separate surface from core effects. The Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques can be employed jointly (and simultaneously) with such spectroscopic analysis to determine such positioning. Our research group have designed and built a Scanning Probe Optical Microcope (SNOM), which is one type of SPM technique, to characterize spatially the single-particles under studies. It also allows to study the near-field luminescent emission. In particular, we study how this influences the thermometric characteristcs of single-particle thermometers.
